# About this Project

**Goal:** The goal of this digital twin is to provide accurate thermal modeling and monitoring of permafrost, enabling better understanding and prediction of subsurface temperature dynamics.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time temperature field simulation using FDM
- Physics-informed neural networks for forward modeling and parameter inversion
- Boundary condition estimation from sensor data
- Visualization of temperature fields and model outputs
- Time-series data storage and analysis
- Message-based service architecture

The system uses InfluxDB for time-series storage and RabbitMQ for inter-service messaging.

# System Architecture

The digital twin follows a microservices architecture pattern, with distinct services communicating via RabbitMQ messaging:

## Core Services

1. **Observation Ingestion Server** (`digital_twin/monitoring/observation_ingestion`)
   - Ingests temperature sensor data
   - Writes observations to InfluxDB
   - Publishes data for other services

2. **Boundary Forcing Server** (`digital_twin/monitoring/boundary_forcing`)
   - Processes sensor data to derive boundary conditions
   - Supports synthetic boundary generation
   - Provides inputs for simulation models

3. **FDM Simulator** (`digital_twin/simulator/fdm`)
   - Classical finite difference method solver
   - Simulates subsurface temperature evolution
   - Writes results to InfluxDB

4. **PINN Forward Model** (`digital_twin/simulator/pinn_forward`)
   - Physics-informed neural network implementation
   - Predicts temperature fields from boundary conditions
   - Optional training mode for model refinement

5. **PINN Inversion Model** (`digital_twin/simulator/pinn_inversion`)
   - Infers soil parameters from temperature data
   - Uses FDM results for parameter estimation
   - Optional training mode for optimization

6. **Visualization Gateway** (`digital_twin/visualization/viz_gateway`)
   - Aggregates results from all models
   - Generates visualization-ready messages
   - Supports real-time data streaming

## Infrastructure Components

- **Communication Layer** (`digital_twin/communication/`)
   - RabbitMQ messaging utilities
   - Message schemas and validation
   - Logging configuration

- **Data Access Layer** (`digital_twin/data_access/`)

# Prerequisites

Required software:
- Python 3.10+
- pip
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

Optional but recommended:
- CUDA-capable GPU for PINN acceleration
- Python virtual environment (venv)

**Note on PyTorch:** The installation method depends on your OS and whether you want CUDA support. Visit https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ to select the appropriate installation command. The `requirements.txt` includes a CPU-only `torch` entry by default.

# Getting Started

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/simplyadil/permafrost_DT.git
cd permafrost_DT
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. (Optional) Install GPU-enabled PyTorch:
```bash
# Visit pytorch.org and follow instructions for your system
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The services use these environment variables (with defaults):

```bash
# InfluxDB Configuration
INFLUX_URL=http://localhost:8086
INFLUX_TOKEN=<your-token>
INFLUX_ORG=permafrost
INFLUX_BUCKET=permafrost

# RabbitMQ Configuration
RABBITMQ_HOST=localhost
RABBITMQ_USER=permafrost
RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=permafrost
```

Set these in your shell or create a `.env` file.

### Infrastructure Setup

1. Start InfluxDB:
```bash
cd software/digital_twin/data_access/influxdbserver
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Start RabbitMQ:
```bash
cd software/digital_twin/communication/installation/rabbitmq
docker-compose up -d
```

Helper scripts are available in `software/startup/docker_services/`:
```bash
python software/startup/docker_services/start_influxdb.py
python software/startup/docker_services/start_rabbitmq.py
```

## Running individual services

Many services are written as simple Python modules you can run directly. Example: run the viz gateway (ensure env vars are set):

```bash
python software/digital_twin/visualization/viz_gateway/viz_gateway_server.py
```

If you run scripts directly from the `software` tree, the tests and some scripts include a small `sys.path` adjustment to allow running modules directly for development.

### Synthetic observation stream

When you do not have physical sensors connected, the startup scripts can recycle the FDM simulator output as a sensor feed. By default `synthetic_observations.enabled` is `true` in `startup.conf`, which makes the FDM server publish depth samples (0–5 m) to the `permafrost.record.sensors.state` queue so the observation ingestion service keeps progressing. Adjust `synthetic_observations.depths_m` (integers 0–5) to change which depths are emitted, or disable the block entirely once real hardware is available.

### Synthetic boundary forcing

The boundary forcing server now falls back to a sinusoidal surface temperature when InfluxDB has no recent observations. Control this via the `synthetic_boundary` section in `startup.conf` (enabled by default). Tweak `start_day` and `step_days` to match the cadence you need, or set `enabled` to `false` once real surface measurements are being ingested.

### PINN forward model

The PINN forward service can operate purely in inference mode. Place your trained checkpoint at `software/models/pinn_forward/freezing_soil_pinn.pt` (or update `pinn_forward.model_path` in `startup.conf`) and leave `pinn_forward.enable_training` set to `false` to skip the costly retraining loop. Flip the flag back to `true` only when you intentionally want the service to optimise the network at runtime.

### PINN inversion model

Similarly, the inversion service can emit precomputed soil parameters without running the heavy optimisation loop. Drop your trained weights at `software/models/pinn_inversion/inversion_pinn.pt` (or point `pinn_inversion.model_path` elsewhere) and keep `pinn_inversion.enable_training` set to `false`. Re-enable it only when you plan to re-fit the inversion PINN from incoming data. The inversion step now consumes the finite-difference simulation results directly, so you can run it alongside—or instead of—the forward PINN without chaining the two together.

## Tests

Integration-style smoke tests live in the top-level `integration_tests/` directory.

Run tests (simple invocation):

```bash
pytest -q
```

Or you can run individual test scripts directly:

```bash
python integration_tests/test_viz_gateway_server.py
python integration_tests/test_observation_ingestion_server.py
```

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### Connection Problems
- **RabbitMQ Connection Failed**
  - Verify `RABBITMQ_HOST` is correct
  - Check container status: `docker ps | grep rabbitmq`
  - Check management UI: http://localhost:15672 
  - Default credentials: `permafrost`/`permafrost`

- **InfluxDB Not Reachable**
  - Verify `INFLUX_URL` is correct
  - Check health endpoint: http://localhost:8086/health
  - Verify container is running: `docker ps | grep influxdb`
  - Check token validity in management UI

### Service Issues
- **PINN Model Loading Errors**
  - Verify model files exist in correct locations
  - Check PyTorch CUDA compatibility
  - Confirm Python environment has correct dependencies

- **Import Errors**
  - Run scripts from repository root
  - Use module notation: `python -m software.digital_twin.{service}`
  - Verify virtual environment is activated
